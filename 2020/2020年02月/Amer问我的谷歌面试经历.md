I only had one round of interview with Google.
The whole video call lasted aound 1 hour. 
I used one minute to do a brief selfintroduction to answer this question "Tell me about yourself a bit". 
After around 5 minutes, I started to write code using Google Doc. 
There were 3 questions asked.
1 An easy level coding problem. 
2 create a web snippt using any web language you are familiar with 
3 data tables design.

ADVICE
Always clarify what you are confused about. 
Don't be afraid to ask question
